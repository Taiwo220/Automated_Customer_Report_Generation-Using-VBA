# 🚀 Automated Customer Report Generation System

*A VBA-powered Excel solution that transforms raw customer data into professional individual reports with a single click.*

---

## 📋 Overview

I developed this project to automate the tedious process of generating individual customer reports from a master dataset for a retail analytics team. Instead of manually copying, formatting, and organizing data for each customer, I built a solution that lets users generate polished, consistent reports in seconds by simply selecting a Customer ID and clicking a button. This tool was specifically designed for the retail/e-commerce industry to support customer segmentation and targeted marketing efforts.

## 🎯 The Problem

Before this automation:
- **Time-Consuming:** Analysts spent 25-30 minutes creating each customer profile
- **Error-Prone:** Manual copy-pasting led to data inconsistencies and mistakes
- **Inconsistent Formatting:** Each report looked different depending on who created it
- **Limited Scalability:** Creating reports for multiple customers was impractical

## 💡 The Solution

An intuitive VBA macro embedded directly in Excel that:
1. **Accepts User Input:** Lets users select any Customer ID from the dataset
2. **Automates Data Processing:** Dynamically fetches all relevant customer metrics
3. **Generates Professional Reports:** Creates beautifully formatted individual reports
4. **Ensures Consistency:** Maintains identical structure and styling across all outputs
